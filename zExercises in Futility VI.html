As if you didn't know how it feels to lose
As if you didn't know how it feels to lose at dice with fate
As if you didn't know
As if you didn't know how it feels to lose at dice with fate

At least have some dignity

As if it wasn't a lifetime
Spent on connecting the dots
There was no pattern
As if the irony was more
Than a defense mechanism
And we could actually laugh for a change
As if steel hooks in our backs
Were more than a nuisance
And we could actually feel something

Self-crucified
Missed the right tree
Tore the wrong eye out
The hissing
Of hellfire

Self-crucified
Missed the right tree
For this I've gained a victory
I burn, as I ought to

As if everything was to be made right one day

Dreams don't come true
For people like us

As if the gods were bored
With peace in our hearts
And their fingers are itchy
As if we never broke people
Out of sheer boredom
And slept calmly, among the wastes

And then, we see bright and clear

As if we would be someone else
While mindlessly wandering through the mountains
As if we would be someone better
Spelling purgatory in Latin alphabet

Self-crucified
Missed the right tree
Tore the wrong eye out
The hissing
Of hellfire

Self-crucified
Missed the right tree
For this I've gained a victory
I burn as I ought to

As if all this was something more
Than another footnote on a postcard from nowhere
Another chapter
In the handbook
For exercises in futility
