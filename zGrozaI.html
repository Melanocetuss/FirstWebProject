Between the grey pillars of conscience
The path to truth narrows
The burden of Aksios, leaking
Through open wounds

Lo and behold, the finely crafted
Precise mechanism of sheep and scapegoat
Relative within the borders of universal logic
Collective confidence in moral permanency

The lowest common denominator is crowned
Standpoints are chosen over general reason
Stars allocated to every man and woman
Fair measure of futile love and will

Fortresses of blissful unconsciousness
Anywhere between Aquinas and Descartes

Blazing a trail as shown, as told
Over the exact same traces
Crawling in circles
With face in dirt and spirit skyhigh

The destroyer of hope, king of rust and wreck
Contract and detract
Harbinger of havoc, wreaker of rule
Truth becomes lie and lie becomes truth

Fortresses of blissful unconsciousness
Anywhere between Aquinas and Descartes

Blazing a trail as shown, as told
Over the exact same traces
Crawling in circles
With face in dirt and spirit skyhigh

The destroyer of hope, king of rust and wreck
Contract and detract
Harbinger of havoc, wreaker of rule
Truth becomes lie and lie becomes truth

Here, in fact, we may be in the presence of one of the most necessary of all Devils
The Ecumenical Unifier, champion of all efforts to remove invidious distinctions
Between nature and nurture, body and spirit, interdiction and impulse, time and
Eternity, individual and community, male and female, Hell and Heaven-and
Ultimately, of course, between man and God
