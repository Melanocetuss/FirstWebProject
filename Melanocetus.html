         <p style="color:white">Melanocetus is a black soft-bodied anglerfish that is dark brown or black in color.Female humpback anglerfish have short, globular bodies, large heads with a widened mouth that is nearly vertical, and long pointed teeth capable of eating prey larger than themselves. Numerous small skin spines are found under the dorsal fin. Compared to other species within the genus, Melanocetus has a longer illicium and fewer jaw teeth, but these teeth are relatively longer than those of other species. Like all other anglerfish, females have a short dorsal fin spine (illicium) with a bulbous luring apparatus (esca) on the snout.The esca has compressed posterior and anterior crests, noted when distinguishing it from other anglerfish. Unlike other species in the genus, females of the species have a nearly straightened anterior margin of vomer. Female M. johnsonii have small, subcutaneous eyes that may suggest their lack of dependency on visual sight for feeding and reproduction.
        <br><br>
        Humpback anglerfish exhibit extreme sexual dimorphism, with larger sized females and dwarfed males. Females have been found to grow up to 153 mm, while males only grow between 15.5 and 28 mm. Males lack a luring apparatus, but have large eyes and nostrils which may be helpful for locating far dispersed mates. While distinguishing characteristics of males in the genus are not well defined, M. johnsonii males usually have a relatively larger number of denticular teeth and dorsal and pectoral fin rays.However, since only eight male specimens were obtained up to date, information concerning males is limited.
        <br><br>
        Also, as there are many similarities in the morphological characteristics of M. johnsonii and M. rossi, one distinguishing feature is that M. johnsonii has black pigmentation on its upper body exterior while M. rossi does not. Because of the numerous similarities between the two, it has been suggested that M. rossi may be a synonym of the Melanocetus species.</p>
